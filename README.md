# Coding Assignment

## Running the app

* Clone the repository
* open console in the project directory
* run `mvn clean install`
* run `java -jar target/codingAssignment-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* the app will ask you to provide the path to the textfile. If no path will be provided then, by default it will
  read `logfile.txt` in `src/main/resources`. You can also replace the `logfile.txt` in this directory before running
  the app.
